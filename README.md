# My-Ai
This is my first AI project, especially formyself because after long time of searching and use of ChatGPT I fix the speech to text problem 
as I'm using Linux-Ubuntu so it cause me issues. After using whisper , vsok and many more then come to speech-recognition
but it had that ALSA lib problem (common in ubuntu) so I had to thoroughly look for the solution so I add index argument in 
my function that is 4 in my case
